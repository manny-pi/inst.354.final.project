## Introduction

1. Introduction: Give the details on the source of your data, its content, and some questions you are interested in

For our project, we have set out to analyze a 'Data Science Salaries 2023 ðŸ’¸' dataset to see if we can use features in the dataset to predict the *job title* of an employee. The dataset list 93 unique job titles, but the two most common by a wide margin are "Data Scientist", and "Data Engineer."

Because of this, we have encoded the job title target column as 1 for data scientists/ engineers, and 0 for any other data related career. Below is our work at processing our data and building a classifier that would help us to predict this target variable.

## Data Cleaning

2. Prepare and wrangle your data. Explain how/why/which variables you selected and justify
dropping/dealing with null values

## Data Preprocessing

3. Split the data into train and test data. Preprocess the data using the StandardScaler

## Model Training and Testing

4. Use scikit-learn Logistic Regression for training and testing your model.

## Model Evaluation

5. Use the classification report and explain the results: Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Confusion Matrix

6. Plot the Confusion Matrix and explain the output

## Splitting the data by Country

7. Split the data according to a demographic variable (gender, ethnicity, age, religion etc.) and go through the steps (4) , (5) and (6) for each category, e.g., old vs young or male vs female.

8. Explain the results of (7) in terms of fairness in AI decision-making: are there differences
among the groups in terms of precision, recall, or the false positive rates?
